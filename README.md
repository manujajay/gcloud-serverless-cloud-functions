# Gcloud Serverless Cloud Functions

This guide covers the setup and deployment of serverless Cloud Functions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions, you can write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services.

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud account
- `gcloud` CLI installed
  - [Install gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Set the project ID:**
   Replace `your-project-id` with your actual project ID.
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

2. **Enable Cloud Functions API:**
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
   ```

## Creating a Cloud Function

Here's how you can create a simple "Hello World" cloud function.

1. **Create a new directory for your function:**
   ```bash
   mkdir hello_world
   cd hello_world
   ```

2. **Write the function code:**

   Create a file named `main.py` and add the following Python code:

   ```python
   def hello_world(request):
       """Responds to any HTTP request.
       Args:
           request (flask.Request): HTTP request object.
       Returns:
           The response text or any set of values that can be turned into a Response object using
           `make_response <flask.Flask.make_response>`.
       """
       request_json = request.get_json()
       if request.args and 'name' in request.args:
           name = request.args.get('name')
       elif request_json and 'name' in request_json:
           name = request_json['name']
       else:
           name = 'World'
       return f'Hello {name}!'
   ```

3. **Create `requirements.txt` for dependencies (if any):**
   ```txt
   Flask==1.1.2
   ```

## Deploying the Function

Deploy your function to Google Cloud with the following command:

```bash
gcloud functions deploy hello_world --runtime python39 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
```

This command deploys the function with the Python 3.9 runtime, triggers it via HTTP requests, and allows unauthenticated access.

## Testing the Function

Once the deployment is complete, you can test your function by navigating to the URL provided by the deployment output.

## Cleaning Up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial:

1. **Delete the Cloud Function:**
   ```bash
   gcloud functions delete hello_world
   ```

## Conclusion

You've now successfully created, deployed, and tested a serverless Cloud Function on Google Cloud Platform. This function responds to HTTP requests with a simple greeting message.
